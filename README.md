## Planning and Process

12/3

I began by creating the wireframes and user stories for this project. My game definitely went through some visual changes between creating the wireframes and starting to lay out the structure with HTML, but it is a good basic structure for how I want my game to look.

12/7

The first day of actual coding for the project, I worked on the file structure and then the authentication process of signing up, signing in, changing the password, and signing out. First I created all of the files I would need for this project inside of my Tic-Tac-Toe game file. Once I had all of the files created I added in some basic HTML elements I would need to test out my auth functions. At this stage, the auth part definitely took be a very long time, as I still did not feel 100% comfortable with this process. I re-watched part of the lesson from this day, which helped me understand what needed to be done. Getting the first auth step of 'sign-up' to work helped me get the syntax down for the rest of the actions.

## Unsolved Problems

I still need to:
- Get 'change password' and 'sign out' auth functionality down
- get 'new game' button working
- Work out game functionality
